DreamTeam: Jeremy Rist and Eric Baiden - Quayson

Description:
This project is a rendition of www.stackoverflow.com.
We will take the basic functions of the site (logging in, posting questions, posting answers, and voting) and replicate them.
We will infuse our our stylistic choices into the final product.

User Stories:
* Visitors can sign up for a new account, so that they can become Members.
* Members can log in (and log out), so that they can contribute to the site.
* Members can ask new Questions, so that others can help them.
* Members can suggest Answers for a Question, so that they can participate in the conversation.
* Members can up-vote or down-vote Questions, to show support for or against.
* Members can up-vote or down-vote Answers, to show support for or against.
* Answers with more support should appear closer to the top of the list (when viewing a single Question).
* Askers -- Members who have asked a Question -- can select an Answer as "accepted", so that they can share with others which Answer worked best for them.
* An Answer that is "accepted" should always appear at the top of the list.
* Anyone (Members and Visitors) can view Questions, Answers and Votes, so that they can see the activity on the site.
* The main page of the site should show "Top Questions", at least.
* Each Question should have a permalink that can be shared.
* The number of Votes and Answers for each Question should appear in any list view.
* Anyone can search for Questions and Answers, so that they can find them faster and more easily.
* Search results should be ranked by quality.
* Results in the list should contain the number of Votes and Answers.
