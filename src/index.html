            <p>Washington (CNN)Forget 2016. Kanye West says he's planning to run for president in 2020.
               In a candid and at times heartfelt acceptance speech at Sunday night's MTV Video Music Awards, the rapper concluded his remarks by announcing a presidential bid for the election five years from now.
               "I don't know what I finna lose after this. It don't matter, though; It's not about me. It's about ideas. New ideas. People with ideas. People who believe in truth," West said. "And yes, as you probably could've guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020 to run for president."</p>
